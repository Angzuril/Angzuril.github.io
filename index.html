<h2>BallFort (C#)</h2>
<h3>About</h3>
<p>BallFort is a simple game I developed in C# using the Unity engine. It supports split-screen play for local multiplayer with up to 4 players. The goal is simply to knock other players off the structure. Once the executable/web player is running, press space on the keyboard, or A on most controllers to join. Once all players have joined, click the "Launch Game" button (you can do this with only 1 player).</p>
<h3>Controls</h3>
<h4>Keyboard and Mouse</h4>
<p>WASD or Arrow Keys to move, mouse to look, Space to jump. Left click is used to hit other players, if there are any. If you are not using the Web Player, press Escape to exit.</p>
<h4>Controller</h4>
<p>Left joystick for movement, right joystick for looking around. A to Jump, Right trigger to attack.a</p>
