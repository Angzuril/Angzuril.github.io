<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>I've always had an interest in problem solving, coupled with a competitive nature. Growing up this drew me to tabletop or virtual strategy games. These factors led me to enroll in Engineering, and become a Computer Engineer. I enjoy developing software on my own time, often to enhance or analyze a game that I'm playing.
<br><br>
I worked hard to earn my Master's Degree focused in Software Engineering and Intelligent Systems from the University of Alberta. My research was based around Recommender Systems, for which I integrated Machine Learning. I have published works in the International Journal of Intelligent Systems, and IEEE Transactions on Computational Social Systems.</p>
